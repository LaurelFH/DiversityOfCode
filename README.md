# DiversityOfCode
An interdisciplinary study observing conversations of diversity in technology through  a combination of close readings of individual texts; analytics including sentiment analysis, text clustering, and lexical analysis; and visualizations, we seek to reveal features of these textsâ€™ vocabularies, rhetorical and affective strategies, and semantic patterns. We will remain alert to any evidence of potential conscious and unconscious bias, relationships, or patterns within and between the corpora on Twitter.
